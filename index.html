        What Should You Look for <br>
        When Joining a Photography <br>
        Club?
    </h1>
    <p><b>.....by SasTik KuMar</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>&emsp; &emsp; Whether you are a <em style="background-color : #1a89171a "> hobbyist or a professional
            photographer </em>, joining a photography club is one of the best ways to improve your skills. <br> The club
        can also be a good venue for meeting people who share the same interest as yours. You will not only form new
        friendships, <br> you’ll also have fun while learning new things about a craft that you love.</p>

            <pre> “There is one thing the photo must contain – the humanity of the moment.”
                                                       – Robert Frank
        </pre>

    <p>
        &emsp; There are two basic types of photography clubs that you can choose from.The first one is the <a href="#"
            target="_blank"> non-competitive club</a>,<em style="color : #ac1c02 "> which is primarily <br>
            focused on providing different opportunities for members to show their work while also opening doors for
            improvement.</em> <br> On the other hand, a <a href="#" target="_blank"> competitive photography club
        </a><em style="color : #ac1c02 "> is one
            where the members want to
            regularly compete and get rewards for their efforts.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        &emsp; This type of club schedules competitions throughout the year and invites distinguished guests to sit as
        judges and critics. Some competitive <br> photography clubs, however, prefer to have fellow members as judges
        for their events.
        <br>
        &emsp; It is important to note, nonetheless, that some non-competitive photography clubs sometimes set up
        competitions among their members as<br>a part of their year-round schedule of activities</em>
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>
        What to Do If You Want to Join One:
    </h2>

    <p>
        &emsp; If you want to join a photography club, the first thing that you should do is ask yourself the reason why
        you are joining. This will help you determine <br> what type of club you should join. Do you want to join
        because you want to meet new friends and improve your craft? Or do you want to join because <br> you want to
        improve your chances of winning in competitions? Are you a competitive person, or would you rather shoot and
        work quietly? <br> The answers to these questions will help you decide which type of club to go for.

    <h2>
        What to Look for in a Photography Club:
    </h2>

    <p>
        &emsp; Aside from choosing the right type, there are other essential elements that you have to consider
        before joining a camera club. In order to get the most <br> out of your membership, you should look for a
        club that offers the best benefits for its members – whether it is in the field of learning or in terms of
        <br> opportunities
    </p>
    <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;Common activities carried out by photography clubs include regular (monthly, bi-monthly,
        quarterly) meetings, exhibits, guest speaker nights, workshops <br> and seminars, competitions, club outings
        and field trips. There are also clubs that prefer to build inter-club associations in order to create a
        stronger photography <br> community. Also, a majority (if not all) of clubs require a membership fee or an
        annual subscription, which will then serve as their main means of funding regular <br> events (like meetings
        and workshops). For special events like exhibits and competitions, clubs usually ask for help from sponsors.

                            “When I photograph I make love.”
                                       – Alfred Stieglitz
                </pre>
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        &emsp; A good photography club offers an excellent mix of activities and venues for learning. Here are
        other elements that you should consider when choosing <br> a photography club
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        &emsp;It shouldn’t be used as a venue for profit making or for setting up a business. A camera club
        is a group that embraces the art of photography, not the idea <br> of making money. If your
        intention is to make money out of your photography skills, you are moving through the wrong
        direction. Go and open <br> a photography studio instead.

        </pre>
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;Choose a photography club that openly tells its members about its mission and vision.
        Members ought to know what they are getting into, so this is an <br> essential factor. The main
        objective of a good photography club should be to encourage its members to take photos while learning to
        love the craft more.
